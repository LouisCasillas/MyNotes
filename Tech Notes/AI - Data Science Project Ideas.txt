# AI/Data Science project idea

Hide and seek against the computer using a mouse or finger.  You take turns being "it" and trying to get the other person.  Computer tries to learn the players patterns.  Possibly a general brain that learns from playing every game with every player.
AI that can read text and then attempt to copy the same style
Show baseball stats on screen for each batter or all players in real-time
Deep learning to find efficiency of network systems and reduce points of failure
Body fat estimation from picture, use pictures of people from real body fat scans
Some way to combine AI with data science?  Maybe determining the best type of graph and creating it for you.
Some strategy game that has no AI yet?
Art generator in certain style
Website live analytics for misc websites using AWS
AI that identifies actors on video on the fly.
