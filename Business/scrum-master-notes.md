		- Ensures Product Backlog items are clear and concise and give enough details for the developers.
		- Continually performs Product Backlog refinement.
		  - Breaking down Product Backlog items into smaller and more precise items.
		    - Add information such as
			  - Description
			  - Value
			  - Priority
			  - Business acceptance details.
			    - For example
				  - Button should be blue.
				  - Address form should accept Chinese characters.
		- Develops and clearly communicates the Product Goal.
		  - Product Goal is the long-term objective for future state of the product.
		- Orders the Product Backlog items to follow the Product Goal and ensure the highest value is achieved first.
	  - Scrum Master / Agile Coach
	    - Facilitate the team meatings, ensure the team is able to do their work, and does't allow extra work to be randomly added to the Sprint.
		- Helps with product planning and helps the Product Owner ensure Product Backlog items are clear and concise and give enough details for the developers.
		- Helps ensure stakeholder collaboration as needed.
	  - Developers
		- Decide on what they can take from the Product Backlog into the Sprint Backlog.
	    - Do the work.
		- Self-organizing and decide how to do their own work.
		- Need to be cross-functional, learn and teach each other.
	
	- Artifacts
	  - Product Backlog
	    - Owned by the Product Owner.
		- Should be sorted acoording to story value and priority.
	  - Sprint Backlog
	    - Owned by the Developers.
	  - The Increment
	    - The result of a Sprint, should be a potentially releasable piece of fully completed work.
		- The Product Owner decides if an Increment should be released or not.
		- Definition of Done (DoD)
		  - In the beginning of the project invite the whole Scrum Team and any other stakeholders your deliverables will be passed to or might have requirements on your work such as a client.
		  - A checklist which details what a complete piece of work includes.
		    - Business/Functional requirements.
			  - Parts of the work that adds direct business value.
			  - Example
			    - User stories with acceptance criteria.
				  - User Story Example 1
				    - As a user, I want to be able to view my past purchases.
					- Acceptance criteria
					  - Should be able to see the date, title, and price of past purchases.
					  - Should be able to sort purchases by date and total spent.
			- Quality.
			  - Quality can be measured subjectively and as a data-driven measurement.
			  - Example
			    - Making sure the code follows defined coding standards.
				- Ensuring the code has unit test coverage.
				- Ensuring no build errors are thrown.
			- Non-Functional Requirements.
			  - Example
			    - Ensuring an API endpoint has rate limiting so it can survive a bad user.
				- Ensuring a piece of healthcare functionality deals with personal information in the proper way as described by laws and regulations.
				- Ensuring the code is properly packaged for any teams the work is passed to such as QA/Testing, Security, DevOps, so on.
