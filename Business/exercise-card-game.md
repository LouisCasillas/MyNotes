# Open Source Exercise Card Game
- TODO: re-write in markdown

- Number Cards = Minion Cards
- Face Cards = Boss Cards
- Reward = 1 minute rest and water

- Pick 4 exercises to represent the 4 suits of a standard deck of cards
  - spade, heart, diamond, clover

- Separate Minion and Boss cards
  - Shuffle each pile and put face down into separate piles
 
- Pick your <difficulty level>
  - easy, medium, hard, champion

- Roll d6 x <difficulty level> and add the numbers together = [rep count]
  - 1=easy, 2=medium, 3=hard, 4=champion

- Turn over a card
  - if you pick a Minion card you do the number of exercises showing and put it in the Minion discard pile once completed
   - if you have used all of Minion cards, re-shuffle the Minion discard pile, and continue
  - if you pick a Boss card you do the Boss card value x [rep count] x 3 exercises from randomly chosen Exercise/Minion cards in the Bosses focus area
  - Jack: 2 x rep count
  - Queen: 3 x rep count
  - King: 4 x rep count
  - Ace: 5 x rep count
  - if you defeat a Boss
   - draw from your exercise focus area and change the exercises used
   - discard the Boss card into the Boss discard pile
  - if you fail to defeat a Boss
   - put the Boss card back into the Boss deck, take a 3 minute rest+water, begin again, do not change the exercises
  - To complete the quest all Bosses must be defeated

<idea> Have strengths and weaknesses for each Boss card
  - Roll a d6 to determine if the Bosses strengths and weaknesses come into player
  - Successful roll is based upon difficulty: 2+= easy, 3+=medium, 4+=hard, 5+=champion
  - if successful the Bosses weakness and strengths come into play
  - if not successful only the Bosses strengths come into play
  - weakness: This Boss hates pushups, to defeat this Boss you only need to do half of the expected pushups
  - strengths: This Boss can do jumping hops for days, you need to do twice the expected number of jump hops

<idea> have a selection of exercises based upon the player's chosen class - areas of focus: strength, mental, agility, speed
   - barbarian - strength = exercises such as pushups
   - wizard - mental = focus more on mental exercises such as remembering a long number after doing jumping jacks
   - archer - agility = focus more on agility exercises such as quick one-foot side jumps
   - race-car driver - speed
   - ninja/rogue - speed + agility
   - space warrior - mental + agility
   - paladin - strength + mental
   - commando - strength + speed
   - ballerina - strength + agility

<idea> give suggestions to change the workout
  - have a time limit of 1 hour
  - feeling tired today?  increase the reward to 2 minutes of rest and make sure you stay hydrated
 
<idea> have a few random "chance" cards flipped at certain times
  - Bosses Buddies - Unfortunately for you this Boss is quite popular among.  Randomly pick another Boss card.  You must now defeat both Bosses to continue
  - Local Tavern - You were dying of thirst when you stumbled upon the local tavern.  Get a fresh drink of water and rest for a minute
  - Resurrection - Your enemy the necromancer is up to his old tricks again.  He has resurrected your last defeated enemy, Boss or Minion.  Defeat this resurrected enemy once and for all to continue
  - Wandering Bard - You hear the lovely music of a wandering bard.  You feel your energy being restored.  Quickly put on a song that gives you energy and continue on your quest
  - Refreshing Waterfall - You found a hidden waterfall in the forest.  Wipe your face with cool water and continue on your quest.
  - Pack of Wolves - A pack of wolves caught your scent.  You see town gates and safety up ahead along the path.  Run as fast as you can in-place for 1 minute and continue on your quest.
  - Visit From A Fairy - Your spirits are soaring after a midnight visit from a fairy.  Until you defeat the next Boss decrease your difficulty level by 1.  If already at easy your next Boss reward will be doubled.
  - Poisoned - You knew that bread was going bad but you were hungry. Until you defeat the next Boss increase your difficulty level by 1.  If already at champion your next Boss reward will be halved.  
  - Quicksand - You thought you were getting shorter when you realized you were slowly sinking.  You keep your wits about you and are able to slowly get out.  You realize you shouldn't have so easily been caught unaware.  Until you defeat the next Boss change your exercise focus to mental.
 
<idea> have relics received from each boss that either makes the workout harder or easier
  - Ball and Chain - Add 3 reps for every exercise
  - Excited Monkey - You've tasted success and you like it.  You're too excited to rest.  Walk/Job/Jumping Jack in place during your breaks after getting water.
  - Lost Marbles - You've forgotten who you are.  Change your area of exercise.  strenght -> speed ... so on

<idea> have location cards to help with the imagination
  - Desert
  - Forest
  - Island
  - Antartic
  - For each location have a corner of the "chance" cards that talk about the event in that location if they would change.
  - Forest - Refreshing Waterfall, Desert - Refreshing Oasis, Island - Fresh Coconut, Antartic - Hot Tea

<idea> have completed quest cards
  - You did an awesome job!  If you maintain a balanced diet and continue to complete quests you're going to feel great and be the hero you want to be!

<idea>
  - have no-equipment, easier, softer on joints, ..., alternate exercises on each Minion card

  - pushups -> knee pushups ->
