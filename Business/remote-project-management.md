# Remote Project Management

## Tips
  - Make sure to incorporate time and costs to budget for team gatherings
  - Make meetings a video whiteboard session instead of just talking heads
  - Build a system for instant communication such as chat room and instant messaging.
  - Try to make meetings collaborative vs simply repeating information
  - Be aware that remote team members might feel removed from the team and lack buy-in.
    - Touch base often with every member of the team and make sure each person is singled out and specially recognized for their work.
  - Over-communicate
    - Make sure everyone is aware of what needs to be done and the goals to be completed.
    - Communicate with project managers and clients.
  - Daily quick standups
    - 1) What they did yesterday.
    - 2) What they are going to do today.
    - 3) If they have any impediments / need help.
  - Have different remote team members review each others work and have a chance for communication.

      - If you fire someone who thinks they are doing well then that is a management failure.
