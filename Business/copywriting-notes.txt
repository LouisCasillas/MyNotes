# Copywriting Notes:

## Direct response history and methodology
 - Two schools of advertising
  - "Brand awareness advertising" or "General Advertising"
   - billboards, TV ads, so on
  - "Direct response"
   - you respond directly to the advertisement to take advantage of the ad
    - you must do something now to get the item
    - easy to track and know if the ads are working
    - easy to track buyers to build a direct marketing list
 
 - A/B Split Tests
  - different versions of ads/layouts/material and comparing the success against each other
   - "Beat the control"

 - best practices
  - longer sells better
   - when someone is genuinely interested in a subject they want to read more
   - more perceived value
   - it takes time to get someone's attention, address their problems/desires, overcome their objections, make them trust you, get them to buy then and there
 
 - direct response copywriter
  - "salesman in print"
  - look for a 2-3% conversion rate - meaning ~97% people don't need to buy to make a campaign be considered successful
  - 3-7% commission of the campaign, $5-10k for the ad campaign
  - "Only sell things you believe in... to people who actually want what you're selling."

 - Things you can sell
  1. Products/Services
  1. Information/Knowledge
  1. Beliefs/Ideas
  1. Entertainment

 - keywords
  - advertorial
   - ad made to look like an editorial
   - at the end asks for an e-mail to gain access to a special presentation or free report
    - creates a lead
  - USP
   - Unique Selling Proposition

 - Influence
  - From Claude Hopkins
   - author of "Scientific Advertising"
    - six principles of influence
     1. Reciprocity
      - "I'll scratch your back, if you scratch mine."
      - "Psychological debt"
      - "Franklin Effect"
       - Ask for a favor
      - How to use:
       - Provide free incentives
       - Offer a free video training series if you sign up to join the presentation.
       - Offer a free gift as a thank-you for considering a donation/purchasing X
     1. Commitment and Consistency
     1. Social Proof
      - "You gotta get this product everyone is talking about it."
      - "This restaurant has 5 stars!"
     1. Authority
      - "Dr. X says you have to use this toothpaste."
      - "Celebrity X said he got a six-pack using this diet and workout plan."
     1. Liking
      - "Difference between someone liking you and not liking you really comes down to whether or not they perceive you to be similar to them in some way."
      - Use mirroring to match the perspective buyer
     1. Scarcity/Urgency
      - "While supplies last!"
      - "Limited time only!"

 - Sell to people's primal desires
  - "There is a reason people actually buy and the reason they tell everyone else."
  - Driven by their lizard-brain
   - pride, vanity, ... deadly sins
   - pre-frontal cortex is the new part that makes you conscious and capable of solving problems and logic
  - Help people imagine what it feels like to achieve their primal desire
   - let the reader "imagine" social praise and validation
  - Types of people:
   1. Ignores their primal desire and try to ignore it or push it away.  They only want to see their self-image as righteous and good.  It is uncomfortable for them to be in a state of "psychic entropy".
   1. Deeper and more accepting understanding of themselves and their primal desires, but will still never openly admit their primal desires and will often try to rationalize away their primal desires.
   1. Person who doesn't give a shit what people think of them and their primal desires.
    - "I want to have sex with beautiful women."
  - Financial drivers
   - fear and greed
    - greed
     - "easy money with little to no work and lots of it"
    - fear
     - "protecting the money you have and not wanting anybody to take it from you"
    - combination - fear of missing out
     - "I don't want to miss out on an amazing opportunity"
     - "Imagine if you got in on the ground-floor of this stock before it explodes over the next few years"
     - "What if you saw what nobody else could see?  Before Wall Street, CNN, Main Street, ... caught on"

 - Parts of a promotion
  1. headline - most important
  	- traditional advice
	 - make it urgent, unique, ultra-specific
	 - advertise some huge benefit right off the bat
	 - famous copywriter John Carlton used the analogy of standing in a crowded, noisy train station
	  - What would you yell out that would get the attention of your audience?
	   - Example:
	    - Attention E-commerce store owners who sell pet products: Here's a simple trick that is guaranteed to boost your sales 1,324% in the next 30 days"
	     - Most people won't care but the specific group 'Pet store owners' will be very interested
	     - Call out your prospect, promise them a big benefit, and do it in an urgent, specific, way that's unique to them.
	- modern advice
	 - what if your prospects are a little more broad?
	  Example: "40 year olds who want a six pack!" -> "Anyone over 18 who wants to have a six pack?"
	 - what if your product has multiple benefits?  which is the most attractive to put in the headline?
	 - headline is just an expression of an underlying idea
	  - underlying idea is the same: "How to grow big watermelons" vs "How to grow monster-sized, juicy, sweet watermelons"
	  - if you change the idea you can change the effectiveness of the headline (and the whole promotion)
  1. lead - most important
  1. body
  1. close

 - Come up with a "Big Idea"
  - Emotionally appealing primary promise + Unique mechanism = Intellectually interesting appeal
  - it is a normal idea that may be a little boring and turns it into something exciting, different, and interesting 
   - The primary promise:
    - Example: Time Ferriss' "The 4-hour Workweek"
    - The primary promise is: "Escape 9-5, live anywhere, and join the new rich"
     - emotionally compelling
     - intellectually interesting peeks curiosity
      - "What is the 4-hour workweek?"
   - unique mechanism - "gimmick"
    - The package or "delivery system" in which the primary promise is delivered
    - Example:
     - A boring hammer next to the same hammer next to a hammer with bright packaging that says "Indestructable Big Bertha"
  - Process:
   - Ask "What is my emotionally-compelling primary promise?"
    - Ask "What is the unique mechanism in which this promise will be delivered?"
