Focus on the 'Foundational 5' to get a good handle on the project.

Leader's Intent:
Understand the needs of the organization
Get clear guidance on the overall task, purpose and end state of the project as desired by your leaders (sponsor and business owners)
S.M.A.R.T. Objectives:
Specific Measurable Achievable/Actionable Realistic and Time based objectives need to be established
Each milestone should be aligned with these
Develop these with the sponsor and business owners
Functional Org Structure:
Who's doing what?
Ask the Resource Managers what skillsets you'll need based on Foundations 1 & 2
Request & Coordinated Resources:
Once you get a better idea of who you need, ask for the people
Include who/what skills, for how long (duration and % of time)
Plan Communications:
What methods will you use
How frequently will you communicate via email, messaging, etc.
How frequently will you meet to escalate needs
How frequently will you send updates or report on dashboards
Godspeed,

ADKAR model of change management.

In brief, there are 5 stages that everyone needs to go through (in order) for a change to "stick":

A=Awareness: do they realize the status quo is a problem?
D=Desire: they've accepted that it's a problem in theory/things would be better if the change was implemented, but are they personally motivated to do anything about it?
K=Knowledge: they're bought in and ready to help implement the change, but do they know how to do their part?
A=Ability: they know how to do their part in theory, but can they actually manage it in practice? (You can read a million books about horseback riding and still fail spectacularly the first time you get on a horse)
R=Reinforcement: they've modeled the new desired behavior at least once, but was that acknowledged enough in any way to motivate them to keep doing it in the future?
