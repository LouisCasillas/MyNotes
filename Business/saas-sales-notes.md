  - Questions
    - Initially you are trying to use questions to determine if you have a serious lead.
		- Qualifying
		  - Making sure the energy is good and the client is a real potential deal.
		- Disqualifying
		  - Asking questions to remove the client from being considered a potential deal.
		- Initially ask questions for need, fit, and energy.
	- Ask "What" questions vs "Who" questions.
	  - Don't ask someone "Who" is in charge of this project.  Might reflexively say they are and not give you the information you want.
	  - Ask them "What" is the process for buying and impelementing this project.
	    - "Oh it has to be qualified by me and then added to the budget by Tom and then signed off by Mary..."
		  - Gives you much more information.
	- Good call where the buyer leaves feeling like they have been heard and your product will solve their issues.
	  - Ask 3 questions first before talking about your product.
