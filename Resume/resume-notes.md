 "Manage multiple million dollar plus projects concurrently." How about something like "Managing $4.2m middleware automation division, with 40 staff both on-site and remote, responsible for increase of $1.2m of annual revenue." Now that tells me something. Budget? How much? Are you over or under budget? How much? I saved my employer a whopping 50% on salary costs throughout all of 2018 and all the way to today, which is nearly a quarter of a million dollars, due to new policies and procedures I personally implemented. Quantify it!
