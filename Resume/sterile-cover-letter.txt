After 14+ years in the computer industry I am looking to start a new career in healthcare.  I recently moved to Gautier, MS and plan to start in the Fall at MGCCC in the Radiography program.  I would really appreciate the opportunity to begin my healthcare career now and continue through the next 2-3 years of schooling.

While I do not have a certification I have previous sterilization experience when I worked for 2.5 years as a cytogenetics lab assistant.  Among other responsibilities, it was my duty to clean and sterilize all equipment using standard PPE, harsh chemicals, and autoclaves.  In this job and also while working for the Arizona Department of Disabilities I was exposed to a lot of unpleasant fluids and smells and I am not squeamish.

I am a hard worker and I believe I would be an asset to the team and I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
-Louis Casillas
