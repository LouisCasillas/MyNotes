# Project Details

     • Backend Migration
        ◦ Budget: ~$2 Million, Duration: 8 months, Team Size: 10 on-shore, 2 remote, 8 local, Methodology: Agile+Scrum
        ◦ Summary: Led a project in migrating a major insurance provider’s backend to a more modernized solution.  The project was made more difficult as anyone with deep understanding of the systems had left or been let go and virtually no documentation existed.  I was given a team of relatively junior developers but through team building and training we ramped up quickly.  I was not involved in the initial project planning and we were given a strict 12 month deadline.  I saw some areas where I thought automation could help us and I wrote some test scripts to show a proof of concept.  My team ran with the automation and we were able to complete the project 4 months early.

    • Children’s Exercise Game
        ◦ Budget: ~$4 Million, Duration: 24 months, Team Size: 8 on-shore, 6 off-shore, Methodology: Agile+Scrum
        ◦ Summary: Led development and design teams in working on and completing an exercise game geared towards children.  I was brought in after a previous company delivered undesirable results and my role was to salvage what was possible and re-build the game as necessary.  After initial project planning and negotiation I was given the team and we began working in two week sprints for two years and my teams did not once miss a deliverable.  My client was always happy with the team’s output and over two years, that I recall, there was only one issue over a misunderstanding about the desired color of a button.  Once the game was completed and released it received very good reviews and only needed minimal bug fixes.

    • DevOps Monitoring Overhaul
        ◦ Budget: ~$5+ Million, Duration: 12 months, Team Size: ~28, 18 on-shore (15 local, 3 remote), 10 off-shore in Taiwan, Methodology: Hybrid
        ◦ Summary: Initially brought in to review a DevOps monitoring system that was throwing more than 10,000 alerts per day and was unusable.  Developed a plan to completely overhaul the monitoring solution to make it usable and provide actionable insight and was given funding.  At first I was given an almost unlimited budget and given the requested team members however the company began going through a takeover and many of my team were let go.  However, through lots of hard work we still managed to complete the project on time and provided immeasurable value to the company.  The value is hard to precisely measure but I know of one monitoring system we created that caught a long-term bug in old code that was estimated to be losing the company $1 million per day.
