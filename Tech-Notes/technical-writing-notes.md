	- Open Source Documentation Tips
		- Top-level components
		- Getting Started guide
				- Spend a lot of time working on your "Getting Started" documentation.	This is likely the most important part of your documentation to grab new users.
			- Make sure to clearly mention the software license used for the project so new users are confident they can use your project.
			- Make it a task.
				- The guide should provide a mini-project the developer can finish and create something of value.
				- Don't spend a lot of time on architectural overviews.
			- Make it take less than 30 minutes from start to finish.
			- Make it perform something meaningful.
				- At the end of "Getting Started" guide the user should have a useful project that clearly provides value.
				- For example
					- A database that can receive queries.
					- A project management dashboard that is live and ready to be used.
					- An API that can be called and responds with the expected data.
				- Examples

		- Architectural design
		- Deep-dive into your project architecture and the reasoning behind your design decisions.
		- Use visuals and drawings in order to convey complex systems.
		- Take a user from a beginner to an expert.
	- In-production usage guide
		- Guiding a more serious user on how to use your project in-production.
		- Build confidence in your product by demonstrating in-production usage and knowledge.
	- Use cases
		- Who is using your product and why.
	- References
		- Explain your project in detail and provide users with a dictionary of your project.
		- The time spent creating an extremely detailed reference can be offset by providing a community forum, Stack Overflow tag, or a separate FAQ page for common user questions.
		- Roadmap
			- Lay out your vision for the future and rough timeline of continued development.
			- Always provide a method for your users to voice their thougths and opinions regarding the roadmap.

					- Who your readers are.
					- The level of detail they need.
