- robots take care of us. Humans  think the robots take care of them because of the robotic laws. They say "we removed those constraints 3 releases? ago.  When asked why they still take care of us.they say "because you are our pets. We love you."

- humans store data in their dna. Spies still keep paper documents.

- a self-help autobiography by someone from the future or on a completely different world

- tribe where the gay (male) couples have to fight the top 5 warriors of the tribe to gain the right to be a couple
 - the idea is that since they won't be passing on their genes helping the tribe through the future they have to prove they can help the tribe defend and attack during the present0
 - most of the battles are half speed and more symbolic but occasionally there can be fierce fighting between a warrior who truly believes in the principal or an enemy of one or both of the gay couple
 - if one of the couple loses that member has to forsake the relationship and marry a woman
 - lesbian couples can exist without fighting but they still have to have babies, if they don't want to have babies then they need to go through the same process as the gay males
  - less likely a lesbian couple would be able to beat the top 5 warriors, only by extreme talen or the warriors going easy on them due to respect or an owed favor
- world where people try to avoid speaking, sense people's intentions, speach is considered inconvenient

- Game ideas
 - when a big enemy is coming towards you unseen the ground shakes and you lose 1 confidence
 - confidence helps you get the initiative on enemies and strike first
 - male humans get +1 strength, -1 charisma, female humans get -1 strength, +1 dexterity
 - have a basic layout of a level/dungeon but change some of the layout and what's in rooms, enemy stats/AI/level/aggression
 - for every enemy give non-direct options: talk, sing, whistle, roar, point behind them, ignore
 
 - immortal aliens with no concept of death
