# Story Ideas

- robots take care of us. Humans  think the robots take care of them because of the robotic laws. They say "we removed those constraints 3 releases? ago.  When asked why they still take care of us.they say "because you are our pets. We love you."

- humans store data in their dna. Spies still keep paper documents.

- a self-help autobiography by someone from the future or on a completely different world

- tribe where the gay (male) couples have to fight the top 5 warriors of the tribe to gain the right to be a couple
  - the idea is that since they won't be passing on their genes helping the tribe through the future they have to prove they can help the tribe defend and attack during the present0
  - most of the battles are half speed and more symbolic but occasionally there can be fierce fighting between a warrior who truly believes in the principal or an enemy of one or both of the gay couple
  - if one of the couple loses that member has to forsake the relationship and marry a woman
  - lesbian couples can exist without fighting but they still have to have babies, if they don't want to have babies then they need to go through the same process as the gay males
  - less likely a lesbian couple would be able to beat the top 5 warriors, only by extreme talen or the warriors going easy on them due to respect or an owed favor

- world where people try to avoid speaking, sense people's intentions, speach is considered inconvenient/uncouth

- immortal aliens with no concept of death

- robots take care of us. Humans  think the robots take care of them because of the robotic laws. They say "we removed those constraints 3 releases? ago.  When asked why they still take care of us.they say "because you are our pets. We love you."

- humans store data in their dna. Spies still keep paper documents.

- a self-help autobiography by someone from the future or on a completely different world/universe

- AI with capabilities to learn but it's lazy

- old space war - random missile hits earth 1,000,000 years later
  - causes some weird affect like a force field in the ocean that causes a weird area in the ocean

- "demons" give pleasure not pain and try to protect humans
  - God sees humans like bacteria
  - demons dont like to see suffering
  - angels created propaganda against demons

- universe is a simulation for people/aliens to run tests on certain things. they care about year 10,000 not our current year.  maybe attempting to see how little changes affect things... see their own history...
  - we are just one simulation of 10,000 and what we experience is really life at 100x the normal speed... 

- future where babies are born with chip brain implants and they can see and talk to AI creatures only they see
  - world population is much less or the people are alone homesteading a far away planet
  - when people are together their creatures sync up
  - babies are born by women but robots do the procedure and implant the brain chips quickly after birth or maybe no need for natural birth
  - what happens when the chips malfunction
  - maybe still have calculation help but the creatures disappear or go buggy
  - how would someone behave if they had never been alone?
    - perhaps one day per week the creatures are turned off to give a chance to update and allow alone time
  - perhaps a chip baby grows up but his chip malfunctions and he leaves to go out around non-chip people. even with half a functioning chip he has many advantages

- future where babies are given an implant with all of human knowledge at birth
  - school is simply helping them learn to access the information and allow the machine to perform calculations for them
  - constant uploads of data to a main human knowledge storage

- big event/disaster taking place from the perspective of a bus driver
  - the bus is neutral territory for bad guys, good guys, warring factions
  - outside people fight but get on the bus peacefully, immediately start fighting off the bus
  - the bus drivers carry a gun and have an almost religious devotion to staying neutral and stay on their route
    - can blow the bus if forced to change route, while driving the driver can stand on a dead mans switch to the bomb, lights inside the bus will glow red and people will straighten up quickly
    - man vs woman, child vs adult, young vs old, crippled vs healthy, neutrality is not broken
    - if a cop or bounty hunter has a person in cuffs they must remove them during the ride, bounty hunter tries to bribe the Driver to break the rule but doesn't work, so the bounty hunter takes the captive off the bus, shoots him in the head, scans him, leaves the body, gets back on, bounty was worth $100k alive only $10k dead
  - perhaps the drivers take people from one outpost to another and between outposts is deadly gas or radiation
  - offshift drivers are talked to with a similar reverance as a priest, "Driver"
  - It is shameful for a Driver to lose his/her neutrality
  - Drivers stand while driving
  - AI is banned so no self-driving, but there is a simple mode to maintain speed and avoid objects
  - Driver can engage the driving mode and go back to breakup a fight or argument

- come up with secular stages of life ceremonies
  - girl/boy coming of age, 25-30 take care of the tribe, 45-50 take care of the young ones and pass on knowledge

- soldier goes through simulation training and is the only one who never screamed while dying

- Galaxy is an organism. Different aliens are different parts.
  - Eyes - see the future
  - Brains - build technology
  - Arms - expand and gather races (humans)

- After an apocalypse humans sit around a fire and exaggerate how amazing previous societies were. "Free energy" "medicine to regrow arms" "no hunger"

- a large alien ship where time stands still upon entering, a local time field, people constantly flow in and out without missing a step, step in and get one year of training or research, and step out as though no time has passed, mechanism unknown, alien spaceship, taken advantage for many things such as research or special forces healing or inventors or ...

- microphone receivers in a room setup so an assassin can see a 3D representation of the room
  - low frequency pings sent out
  - uses a virtual reality helmet that let's him/her see in pitch dark or pure smoke

- scientists keep all info about a dangerous new technology on paper so that if it is as bad as expected future generations won't know about it
  - far future people trying to discover the techbology by searching for the paper

- special operation people have their brains scanned and go through simulated training
  - experiencing a 1,000 kills, missions, deaths
  - testing if they can hack it rather than putting them through grueling training

- a love story and you dont realize its about birds in a giant tree

- a world where all levels of living creatures have some form of political representation.
  - a machine can read general mental feelings from lower animals like ants, sense thoughts from elephants, so on
