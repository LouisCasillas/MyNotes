# Cooking tips
- Taken from:
  - America's Test Kitchen
  - Rouxbe Cooking School

## Cleaning
- 1 tbsp bleach to 1 quart water
  - kills almost all bacteria
- boil sponge and rags for 5 minutes

## General tips
- if mixing with one hand and pouring with the other hand you can help steady the bowl by wrapping the bottom of the bowl with a towel or putting the bowl into a bigger pan
- use side to side whisking for all needs except for whipping egg whites (use beating method up and down)
- sprinkle spices and salt from high up for more even distribution
 
## Cast iron pans
- use a drop of soap when cleaning
- use refined vegetable oil for seasoning
- acidic foods no more than 30 minutes and remove quickly
- can use as a "flame tamer" for even heating
  - put cooking pan inside cast iron skillet
- use two as panini
- use as pie plate

## Salmon
- can feel small pin bones with hand and remove with tweezers
- fold small parts and use toothpick to make salmon similar size for even cooking

## Pasta
- 2 tsp lemon juice to 4 qt water
  - keeps pasta from being sticky
- salt the water
- don't add oil to cooking water
- save 0.5 cup cooking water and add back to pasta sauce

## Lemon
- 2 tsp juice to 1 cup recipe with vegetables to keep them fresh longer
- Substitute for wine in recipes
  - 0.5 cup wine => 0.5 cup chicken broth + 1 tsp lemon juice
- before squeezing the juice onto a dish try grilling lemon halves to carmalize sugars first
- how to store
  - store whole lemons in zip lock back
  - store zested lemon in plastic wrap before refrigerating
  - store juice or zest in zip lock bag in the freezer

## Pizza
- try using gravity when rolling out pizza dough
  - when stretching the dough let a portion hang over the edge of the table or knuckles and keep rotating
- if using a normal oven keep pizza on a baking stone in a tight space at the top of the oven so heat is reflected off the stone and back to the pizza
- create steam in oven while baking the bread by using hot lava rocks on a pan, heat the lava rocks while the oven is heating up and pour boiling water onto the rocks and pan, then put the bread in the oven and while doing so pour more boiling water onto the rocks

## Garlic
- size of the cut garlic changes the power of the garlic. The smaller the garlic is cut the more powerful the flavor.
- the longer garlic is left out alone the stronger the flavor
  - to stop the increase in flavor heat the garlic to over 140F or mix with acid
- fat soluble
  - cook garlic in butter to pull out the most flavor
  - once cooked add unmelted butter to make it easily spreadable and add hydrated garlic powder 

## Bread
- if adding extra toppings before baking (such as seeds) use a wet towel and roll the dough over the wet towel to evenly wet the dough surface, then roll the dough on a pan with the toppings
- after kneeding and after the dough has been resting 30-60 minutes take it out and fold it 6-8 times and put back to rest, repeat 3-4 times
- testing dough for properly proofed dough
  - good - will feel spongy and indents will fill, should be 2x original size
  - under - will feel firm and indents will bounce back, not 2x original size
  - over - indents will not fill in, 2+x original size and then collapsed
- instant yeast
  - instant yeast does not need to be mixed with water and proofed
  - needs 25% less than active dry yeast

## Flour
- bread flour (King Arthur) is high protein and high gluten
  - good for bagels and pizza or anything you want to be chewier
- cake flour does not have much gluten, just enough to create structure
- all-purpose flour is inbetween bread and cake flour

## Pickling
- onions 
  - sweet and spicy
    - 1 cup red wine vinegar, 0.333 cup sugar, 2 thinly siced jalapenos, 0.25 tsp of salt
    - bring to boil
    - pour over 1 thinly sliced red onion
    - let sit for at least 30 minutes

## Tomatoes
- cut canned tomatoes while still in the can with scissors
- store whole tomatoes stem-side down

## Vanilla

  - sprinkle sugar on the outside of the bean and use the sugar to squeeze off all the vanilla seeds and flavor
    - do on both sides

## Nuts
- to remove the skins
  - put nuts in the oven @ 350F for 10-15 minutes
  - when cooled remove the skins by rolling the nuts by hand in a strainer

## Pie
- Crust/Dough
  - use butter (3 parts) and shortening (1 part)
  - don't mix all flour together
    - mix most of the flour but save 1 cup of flour and add it at the end and then stir
  - add 4 tbsp of vodka
  - chill dough
    - ideally let dough rest 24 hours in refrigerator
  - once dough is out of the refrigerator wait at least 15 minutes before rolling
  - when cooking the crust/shell put tin foil over the raw crust and add ball weights to keep the crust from bubbling
    - put shell in oven at 375F for 15-30 minutes (partially baked pie shell, "blind baking")
    - take the shell out and remove foil and weights
      - if using a hot filling like in pumpkin or pecan pie add filling now and return pie to oven to baked
      - if using a cold filling return pie crust oven at 375F for 10-12 minutes, until light golden brown, remove, and let cool (fully baked pie shell)
  - if the crust cracks use extra dough to fill the hole
- filling
  - usually frozen fruit is called for
    - if using fresh, simmer down fresh fruit for 20 minutes
  - make sure filling is hot when pouring into the pie crust
  - cook until the filling is around 175-185F
  - filling should still jiggle a little and will set while cooling
- cut the pieces before removing each slice
- for meringue pies
  - add sugar to egg whites about 40-60 seconds  after whipping
- run unbaked pie under the faucet or brush gently with water - helps dough hold onto sugar

## Cake
- when using powdered sugar use strips of paper or other objects on the cake to create decorations 
  - can use multiple layers of the same powder or use powdered sugar and cocoa powder for interesting designs
- if drawing decorations first use a toothpick to trace the drawing in the icing, if you mess up smooth the icing and start again, then follow the lines with the colored icing for the drawing
- you can use two colors of frosting side-by-side while decorating to make it look professional
- fill a zip lock bag and cut corner to decorate cakes

  - use folded newspaper or cheesecloth and dampen
  - wrap with tin foil and place around the cake pan
  - tie with wet twine

## Salt
- always measure by weight not volume
- amount of salt added to meat is dependent on the amount of fat in the meat
  - turkey breast, pork loin - 0.5% salt by weight
  - strip steak, ground beef (90%) - 0.75% salt by weight
  - ground beef (80%) - 1% salt by weight
- add salt at the beginning of the cooking process
  - if adding salt at the end use only 25% of the salt called for, stir, and taste - salt can't be absorbed into the food as quickly and will taste saltier
- after a dish is done use sea salt flakes
  - to prevent immediate melting spray a bowl with pam and then add 1.5 tsp of flaky sea salt (fleur de sel) to the bowl and lightly mix and then put the salt onto the food

## Steak
- if freezing meat
  - first put in freezer on baking sheet with parchment paper uncovered

  - sear until browned - 90 seconds per side
  - transfer to wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet
  - cook in 275F oven - usually 18-20 minutes for 1 inch thick steak
- best way to sear steak
  - get steak about 1 inch thick
  - rub on steak a mix of 1 tbsp of corn starch to 2 tbsp of kosher salt 
  - wipe steak dry, place on wire rack, rub cornstarch and salt mixture all over the steak on all sides
  - place the steaks while on the rack in the freezer for about 30 minutes
- basting is useless and makes the skin soggy
  - brine meat if moist meat is desired
- if meat is stuck to pan wait until the food is browned at high temperature and then flip
  
## Grains

- rice
  - when to rinse rice
    - don't rinse brown rice
    - rinse if pilaff, steamed rice, or rice salad
    - don't rinse if making risotto or rice pudding
  - water ratios
    - if the rice is cooked in an airtight container without evaporation you can always use a 1:1 water to rice ratio, adjust for each individual
    - the reason for adding extra water to rice is compensation for evaporation during cooking
    - if using the same cooking method and pot and you want to increase the amount of rice only add extra water equal to the added amount of rice as the rate of evaporation will not increase with added ingredients
- general grain cooking
  - absorption method
    - add 0.5 tsp of salt to water per cup of grains
    - pour in water and bring to simmer without lid on at medium-high until boiling and then lower heat to low and put lid on, maintain simmer
    - when grain is tender and the liquid is absorbed take off heat and keep covered for 10-15 minutes
      - if you want really fluffy rice put a towel over the pot and then put the lid back on so the towel will capture rising steam  
    - fluff with fork
  - pilaff method
