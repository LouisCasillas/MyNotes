
- cooking building
 - giant wood table for chopping and preparing
 - homemmade pizza-style oven - barrel for wood at the bottom, heat goes up into the barrel for cooking
 - tilt towards South-east to block sun and wind
  - perhaps only have 3 open sides and the blocking side completely down
   - can use the wall for hanging and storage
 - use weed sprayer for pressure to clean dishes
 - find small pressure cooker (stainless steel not aluminum, thick bottom) with nub handles so it can easily fit into thermal cooker

- exercise building
 - one wall closed so rain can't get in to weights - read wind charts to find best direction for the wall to stop the most rain
 
- sleeping building
 - at least 6-8 ft up with pillars so it's easy to walk under and clean and repaint
 - at least 20 ft x 20 ft
 - open walls with shutters or hinged/sliding walls to close for privacy
  - alternative: keep open but have a loft for sleeping and clean clothes, covered holes for wind flow

- shed for tools/feed
 - have tall bench for working on things
 - metal trash cans to keep out rats

- storm shelter
 - possibly make bigger and combine with the shed
  - how big can a concrete roof be without support?
 - concrete block with reinforced rebar and concrete and then cover with traditional-style home 
 - need to find very strong metal door with large bolts.  maybe an old bank vault door?
  - door should open inward
 - make sure there are air vents
 - how to make it raised off the ground?  maybe just have 5 layers of just brick for the base and then start the walls
 - make sure there is a vapor barrier installed under the floor
 - slope slightly to the middle and have a drain hole for easy cleaning
 - rough up the surface of the concrete inside with a concrete cleaning/etching solution to reduce condensation
 - apply garasge floor coating with nonslip granules or sand to provide better traction
- wood path
 - create wood path from home -> bathroom -> cooking area
 - have the wood raised at least 1 foot
 - have a simple roof overhang to keep rain off

- drying room
 - use the box with metal rain gutters pushing air into the room
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SniCLlTIIAs
 - possibly have a wind generator that powers heating elements with fans
  - what is the smallest wind generator for this purpose and how loud is it?
 - https://fifthwindfarm.blogspot.com/p/solar-dehydrator.html
 - have a small flap door where the rain gutters push air into the room
 - at the opposite bottom cut hole so smoker can push air through tube and the smoke will flow up through the food
 - have a contraption with little oven box at the top of the rain gutter box so the hot air can be pushed into the little box and cook food
 - add drying rack that moves up and down (see building idea pictures)
 - make it wide enough and figure out how to allow at least 2 or 3 baking sheets
 - use polyiso insulation - others will melt
 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a62mZMIMpc0
 - combine solar air heater with solar water heater
  - use metal drain spouts and run pex tubing/copper up and down each one
   - max temperature of the pex tubing?
   - will the pex tubing reduce air heating too much to be useful as a solar dryer?
 
 
- offgrid refrigerator
 - If using peltier and using PC fan heatsinks use nylon screws to connect heatsinks to reduce thermal bridging

- icebox
 - probably makes sense to use cooler inside insulated box
  - allows easy removal of the cooler and double uses
 - Ice box should have 1x1 ft internal dimensions for food area
 - Top and bottom area for ice should have the  dimensions of a standard 10 lb bag of ice
   - ice should go in the top so the cold air can flow over the food and bottom so food that needs to stay coldest goes on the bottom
 - wall r-values should be 10-15
 - needs a grate and water pan at the bottom
 - air gaps between insulation no more than 0.5 inch

 - perhaps combine with rotisserie
 - perhaps add a small computer fat to distribute the hot air better
 - when creating a parabolic mirror with thermal tape look into how car tint is professional applied and use similar techniques 
 - box solar cooker that has insulation on flaps on each side so that it can convert from a solar cooker to a thermal cooker by closing the sides
  - like a box inside another box, the outside box is a solid the thermal cooker and the inside box is a solar cooker that has mirrors and glass walls
  - perhaps add some type of monitoring so that the solar cooker will
   - close itself after a set period of time
   - close itself once a wired thermometer has reached a certain point
   - the thermometer could be measuring the air or be pushed into a piece of meat to measure the meats internal temperature
    - have a memory of the temperature to ensure the meat actually did reach the desired internal temperature, max (how long was it at this temperature)
   - close itself when it notices the sun has gone away and then reopening when the sun is back again
   - perhaps it can have a very simple circular plate underneath so that the solar cooker can turn itself towards the sun
   - perhaps have some type of heat storage mathod such as sand, salts, oil, phase-change material, ...

  - timer to lightly tip egg boxes so eggs slide down to a central position for easy gathering - make sure everything is padded
  
- shower stall
 - make it raised up so water drips down into pan and then goes into deep tube for drainage or stored for grey water uses OR use weed sprayer for pressure
 - possibly keep shower and kitchen close together so raised 55 gallon drum with water can be used for both
 - have a valve on the drainage tube so grey water can be collected on the side
  - pipe -> elbow -> shut off valve 
      |
	  \/
	  shut off valve
	  |
	  \/
  - perhaps have a smaller tank with 10 gallons (mini water heater) that has black tubes that circulates hot water so the shower water can be hotter than the 55 gallon tank feeding it
   - if using pex tubing protect from uv somehow
   - perhaps have a mechanism like a first flush diverter from the 55 gallon tank to the smaller tank so the hot water doesn't circulate back into the 55 gallon tank and the smaller tank is a closed system once it's full of water
   - have a temperatute gauge
   - perhaps use evacuated tubes to rapidly heat the system... but water will probably be too hot for a shower
  - maybe insulate the water tanks to keep them above 140F all the time to prevent certain diseases

  - put into thermal cooker at night?
