  - Notes
    - Next time use a full 4 lb sack of sugar, 2 lb for each bottle of water
	
	- 1 gallon to 2 lb sugar
	  - how much water to remove first?

    - Water
      - 2 gallons
	    - Removed water until the line was above the top of the label by about 1.5"
	  - Temperature ~74F
	  - Did not boil or heat
	  - No airlock, using just the cap
      - Crystal Geyser (spring water)
  
    - Yeast
      - Active Dry Yeast (0.25 oz, 7g)
	    - Half in each bottle of water
	      - Shake softly until dissolved and cloudy
      - Great Value
	
    - Sugar
      - 1.75 lb per bottle
	    - Once pour into bottle did not shake the bottle, a lot of sugar ended up on the bottom.
	      - The theory is that the sugar will slowly dissolve on it's own and give the yeast time to wake up and not be overpowered by water with too much sugar.
